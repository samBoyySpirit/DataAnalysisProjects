# Scenario.

AltiQ Hardware(fictitious) is a Computer Hardware and Peripheral Manufacturer. Head office is in Delhi.

Market is growing dynamically. The Sales Director is finding it difficult to track sales in the Regional Markets(North, South and Central)

# Stage 1: Ask.

## Requirement:

To unlock sales insights that are not visible before for Sales team for decision support and to automate them to reduced manual time spent in data gathering.

## Stakeholders:
* Sales Director, who is the primary stakeholder for this project.
* Marketing Team, they are secondary stakeholders.
* Data & Analytics Team, that has to create a dynamic dashboard and provide insights from the data gathered.
* IT team, that has the all the required data maintained in a MySQL server.

## Expectation: 

An automated dashboard providing quick and latest sales insights in order to support data driven decision-making.

## Success Criteria:

* Dashboards uncovering sales order insights with latest data available.
* Sales team able to take better decisions to prove 10% cost savings of the total spend.
* Sales analysts stop data gathering manually in order to save 20% of their business time and reinvest it in value added activity.

## Business Task:

Create an active dashboard that helps Sales Director track sales data every month which will help them make a data-driven decisions.

## Stack:
* Data source: MySQL table converted to .csv.
* Data processing: Python Pandas Library.
* Data Visualization: Tableau Public.

# Stage 2: Prepare.

## Data Source:

* The dataset provided by the AltiQ IT Team was stored in the MySQL Server owned by the team. The `.sql` file is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samBoyySpirit/DataAnalysisProjects/master/2_SalesInsightsTableau/docs/db_dump_version_2.sql).
* Converted the `.sql` file to `.csv` files for processing stage in Pandas Library. The `.csv` files are available [here](https://github.com/samBoyySpirit/DataAnalysisProjects/tree/master/2_SalesInsightsTableau/docs).
* The reason we are converting `.sql` file to `.csv` files is that for data visualization, we are using Tableau public, which does not provide the feature of connecting to the MySQL server. It allows for the loading of `.csv` files.

## Organization of Data:

The tables in the database is organized in a *Star Schema*. It includes *one* fact table(sales.transactions) indexing *four* dimensional tables(sales.customers, sales.date, sales.products, sales.markets).

![star schema](images/database_sales_schema.png)

All the events and transaction related attributes are in the fact table and the remaining characteristics attributes are put in the dimension tables.

## Does the data need cleaning?

Yes, after quick initial analysis, the data is in need of cleaning. Here are the following issues observed in the dataset.
* In the sales.markets table, New York and Paris market has null values in zone.
* In the sales.transactions table, there are two records whose currency and sales amount has been listed in USD.

# Stage 3: Process.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

* The section where EDA is performed is in `sales_insights_eda_data_cleaning.ipynb` .

## Data Cleaning - Documentation:

* The data cleaning documentation is in `sales_insights_eda_data_cleaning.ipynb` .

## Key Insights:

### Revenue and Sales Quantity.

* In Revenue trendline, from the period of `Q3 2017` to `Q2 2020`, the revenue has been declining steadily. The strongest performance in this period has been on the `year 2018` with `42.52M` in sales amount.
    - The total revenue genarated in `2018` is `413.69M`.
    - The lowest dip in sales amount was in `Q2 2020` with just `14.71M`.

* In Zone wise breakdown, the *North Zone* has the highest share of sales amount with `675.53M` for the period `Q3 2017` to `Q2 2020`. The *North Zone* is the biggest market, with *Central* coming in second with `263.72M` and finally *South Zone* with a meagre `45.56M` in sales amount.
    - The distribution of the Zone wise breakdown has remained consistently same every year, with *North Zone* dominating in generating revenue.
    - *North Zone's* strongest performance came in the year `2018` with `287.04M`.
    - *South Zone* had a poor performance in the year `2020` with `6.66M` in revenue.

* When we breakdown the Revenue(sales amount) by Markets, the top 5 markets are: *Delhi NCR*, *Mumbai*, *Ahmedabad*, *Bhopal* and *Nagpur*. *Delhi* and *Ahmedabad* belongs to the *North Zone*, while *Mumbai*, *Bhopal* and *Nagpur* contribute to the *Central Zone*. Markets from the *South Zone* have relatively smaller revenue generated.
    - *Delhi* has a relatively majority share with `519.51M` in revenue generated. Compared to *Mumbai* which is second in sales is `150M`.
    - *Bhubaneshwar* and *Bengaluru* markets are at the bottom, generating revenues less than a million.
    - Markets in the *South Zone* have a total revenue generated of `45.56M` for the given time period. *Kochi* is `18.81M`, *Chennai* is `18.04M`, *Hyderabad* is `7.44M`, *Bhubaneshwar* is `0.89M` and *Bengaluru* with `0.37M` is the lowest.

* Revenue breakdown by Customers shows an interesting trend, where Customer *Electricalsara Stores* has the lion's share with `413.33M` in revenue generated. The second highest customer, *Electricalslytical* is only a mere `49.64M`.
    - *Electricalsara Stores* has presence in *Central* as well as the *South Zone*, but it's major business is in *Delhi* Market(Central Zone) with `410.54M` revenue.
    - *Electricalsara Stores* also has the highest sales quantity numbers for the given period with `653.82K` sales.

* When we breakdown the sales quantity by Markets, we see that *Delhi* has the highest share with `984.20K` and Bengaluru with the lowest sales numbers, `0.24K`.

### Profit Margin.

* *Delhi* market has the highest profits made for the given time period with `11.94M`, followed by *Mumbai* - `4.87M`, *Ahmedabad* - `2.85M`, *Bhopal* - `2.29M` and *Nagpur* - `1.41M`.
    - The rest of the Markets have made profits less than 1M each.
    - *Bengaluru* and *Kanpur* are under loss with `-0.08M` and `-0.07M` respectively.

* While *Delhi* has the biggest market and has the highest transactions, it's *profit margin* is just mere `2.30%` considering it's size. Meaning, despite having the highest sales quantity figures, Delhi contributes very little to the overall profitability of AltiQ.
    - Markets like *Surat*: `4.86%`, *Patna*: `4.12%`, *Bhubaneshwar*: `3.98%`, *Bhopal*: `3.90%` and *Kochi*: `3.74%` have better profit margin than *Delhi*.
    - *Bengaluru* has the worst profit margin: `-20.78%`.

### Customer and Product types distribution.

* There are two types of Customers, *Brick & Mortar* and *E-commerce*. *Brick & Mortar* contributes to `75.59%` of the overall revenue generated, i.e `744.47M` and *E-commerce* is `24.41%` at `240.34M`.
* In the Product types distribution, `51%` of the products sold were *Own Brand*, `4.55 %` were *Distribution* product type, the rest `44.76%` is *Others*.

# Stage 6: Act.

## Top 3 Recommendations:

* While the *Delhi* market has the highest sales quantity and is the biggest generator of revenue as well as rakes in good profits, it's **profit margin is very less** . As *Delhi* is an established market, it is better to increase the profit margin by a small percentage to increase the profitability of AltiQ. 
    - *Delhi* is over reliant on a single customer with bulk share of revenue. Adding new customers could also help with better distribution and **increase in sales amount**.
* To drive marketing initiatives to the *South Zone*. While the *South Zone* contributes less to the overall revenue of AltiQ for now, it has **potential to increase**. Markets like *Bhubaneshwar* and *Kochi* have **better profit margins**. *Kochi* and *Chennai* have contributed `19M` and `18M` respectively, which is a decent sales amount.
* *Bengaluru* market needs a different business strategy as it has been a very poor performer as show in the analysis performed.
